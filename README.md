# Project

The primary goal is to render a `.ply` file that comes with a texture file from different camera angles. This is crucial for most vision pipelines utilizes pose-estimation with template matching.

## Getting Started

The project is coded in python and should be extremely portable, but I have only tried it on `ubuntu-noetic`.


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Install the following via pip or any favorite package installer
  ```sh
  pip trimesh
  pip pyrender
  pip matplotlib
  ```

### Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Create the folder `imgs/templates` or modify the ``settings.json`` file according to your needs.

3. Usage:
    ```sh
    Python3 src/generate_templates.py
    ```
4. There should now be generated rendered images and their poses located in `imgs/templates`.
